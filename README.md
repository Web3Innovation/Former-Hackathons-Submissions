### Battleshot!

An NFT turned based multiplayer game. The game let's people play against each other using their favorite NFT.

This will evolve into allowing people to have special power ups depending on collection rarity and even mint their own dynamic NFTs based on their game record. This is for now a basic version of the game to show the potential of using zora+redis as a winning combination for NFT gaming.

### ZoraGM Mobile kit

For Web3 to gain user adoption and attract builders, apps user interface and experience needs to evolve into more rich, intuitive and customized solutions for mobile. Building native apps is a great way to get the most out of devices capabilities and resources to create personalized experiences. I created this project to show other native devs how easy it is to integrate your apps with web3 content (thanks Zora for this API!) and not feel overwhelmed by the steep learning curve to start developing with web3 apps. Mobile native experiences will become very important when it comes to NFT gaming and metaverse applications.

This project is a quickstart with sample code and tools to use ZORA API to query blockchain information for native iOS apps. The sample apps queries and displays NFTs

### Zora-powered NFT AI Scanner

Have you ever wanted an image search, like in Google, but for NFTs? Now, with Zora's API and our outstanding data science expertise, this has become possible.

We present you an app that uses neural networks to find NFTs using text requests: picture of monkey? Done! 8-bit skeleton art? Here it is. If there's an NFT, we'll find it for you. And that's just the tip of the iceberg!

Do you want to check the authenticity of any NFT art? Our deep learning algorithms will scan through the blockchain and find out whether there are collections that look suspiciously similar to yours!

Finally, here's one more thing - our neural networks can also generate new NFTs! Just send your wallet address, and we'll synthesize a MetaNFT - all NFTs in your account, blended together by generative networks.

### ThisNFTdoesnotexist

This is our solution for creating non-existent and truly unique NFTs, which can be immediately uploaded to IPFS and the blockchain. The current version allows you to pick and create NFTs on the Rinkeby network.

We have created an open source organization on github, where any member of the community can ask questions and use it for themselves and help improve the code!


To show the user the NFTs that already exist in the collection, we use the Zora API, as well as media react components to display the correct image from the IPFS. At the moment, data is displayed from the collection, the images for which we used in our dataset for training. This is because of the inability to deploy the contract in the mainnet.

### NFT exes

This project aims to bring more attention to individual NFT history to make them more distinguishable even inside their own collection.

How it works:
You can enter your address to see all past owners of your NFTs and how long they was holding it. Addresses of some people would be highlighted with certain color. Famous people, such as Beeple and Vitalik, would be highlighted with blue, while any punk or BAYC holder would be highlited with amber. In the future there would be more categories for better navigation

if you want to see this project in it's full glory, you can use 0x367dc97068ab54ba1dfbfc0fad12fbcb7b3a0d09 address as input

This is my first experience in frontend, sorry for bad adaptability!

### .*^/yume\^*.

to understand how we’ve made use of the API, first we must introduce you to yume. 

in short, we are building a decentralised fashion marketplace, where you buy clothing designs (as nfts) which you can then redeem for the actual garment. the nft contains all the metadata needed for the production of the clothing, so any manufacturer can handle it. this eliminates waste, empowers small creators, fights fast fashion, facilitates merch releases by organisations, accompanied by a number of other benefits on which you can learn more in our docs or articles.

coming back to Zora API: we used this tool to create a demo of yume’s marketplace, a visualisation of how it could potentially look like once it launches, a simulation of a sort. (maybe it is a potential partnership with zora and added utility to zorbs, who knows)

however, since there are no yume clothing nfts released yet, we instead chose a handful of zora nfts, and gave them the status of “yume eligible”. 

as such, we then used the API to display all these (yume eligible) zora nfts in one place, presenting all kinds of information (for example recent and biggest sales), with the possibility to sort through them based on your chosen criteria. this should reflect how you would browse through all yume clothing nfts. it has the same features: if you want to filter out all t-shirt designs, or you want to see all available gray and blue designs, using the API you will be able to accomplish that! the only missing element is the “buy” feature, but it was not necessary for demonstrating the use of the Zora API.

moreover, we created a “dashboard” feature, which is an equivalent of your “clothing nfts closet”. it provides you with an overview of your collection, where you can see the details and if you wish so, redeem for a physical item. it is exactly the same experience as you would have with your yume clothing nfts.

by the way, if you happen to own any of the zorb nfts, you will see them there. and who knows, maybe there will be enough interest in the zora community that these yume eligible Zora nfts will be actually made into yume merch one day!

### Ponder

My submission is a lightweight, native objective-c client to consume GraphQL output from the ZORA API.

This is the bare minimum necessary to interact with the ZORA API using obj-c without third party libraries or frameworks.

A demonstration of the capabilities takes a contract address as input, and shows various stats such as the contract name, symbol, total supply, total number of owners, as well as a breakdown of the top 20 owners.

 Additionally, a more in-depth demonstration of the analytics capabilities made possible with the ZORA API can be found with the “Get Top Collections” feature (output is currently logged to console rather than displayed in GUI), which processes the wallets for all token holders for a given contract, and generates the top 10 shared collections across those wallets. This could be useful for community building, outreach, marketing, and tracking emerging trends in the NFT ecosystem. (Please note that this feature takes awhile to run, and these calculations could be performed much more efficiently on the backend. Perhaps some convenience accessor methods from the ZORA team in the future for some of this type of data?)

### Zorbz Data Visualizer

ZORBZ is our MVP data visualization tool using ZORBS metadata, creative code with p5 js, and  Zora’s API(zAPI) 💻

This implementation was inspired by tx-street.com and HASH by Proof of Beauty. With Zora's zAPI, we’re able to abstract that meta data, and use it as a parameter for things, like visuals, so we can further understand things happening on the blockchain beyond zeros and ones.

### EveNFT

NFT / Token walled event ticketing app. Organisers create event and selecting a collection required for entry (API use search). Attendees on arrival scan a QR code generated by app to verify ownership of collection at door (API use NFTs for wallet). Database saves the collection address so another API use is when this data is retrieved - we need a the UI friendly name, so look this up using API.

Example use case: NFT NYC next week, a lot of events are for token holders, they need to be able to verify this on the door.

Next Steps(more backend related):
Platform persists attendees list for organisers to later use for exports for airdrops etc. Also recommend events which other participants are going to based on previous shared participations.

### NFT Brew

NFT Brew is aimed at helping people keep track of NFT collections with daily emails.

You sign up with your wallet, specify your email, select collections you want to keep track of and every morning receive an email with a breakdown of how each collection did in the previous 24 hours. Average sale, highest sale, lowest save, volume, the difference to the day before this.

All to help you keep your eye on interesting collections with easy-to-check emails that you have daily.

### zora-kit

ZoraKit -- https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-zorakit and https://github.com/benschac/zorakit

What is the hack?

During the twitter spaces event Jem, floated the idea of a Zora dev tool to bootstrap a project with the Zora API, RainbowKit and GraphQL.

What does ZoraKit do?

yarn create zorakit@latest and you'll get a bootstrapped Zora GraphQL Project.

- What's in ZoraKit?
- ApolloClient
- Zora GraphQL API
- RainbowKit (wagmi, ethers.js)
- @zoralabs/nft-components/
- typescript support
- next.js
- graphql-codegen (which autogenerates react hooks based off your queries and the graphql introspection layer). What's super nice about codegen is the developer gets type safe hooks and data responses right out of the box. https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/ more here if anyone is interested.

The template will connect to a wallet via RainbowKit and load your NFT's via Zora API and Zora NFT-Components. Side note, only two of my NFT preview thumbnail images were rendering. Assuming it's just the NFT not having a thumbnail field.

How it was built:
- Forked RainbowKit, threw in the template above and published it to npm.


There's still a little bit of clean up to do and doc updates but I wanted to post it sooner than later if it would be helpful for anyone else starting their project
